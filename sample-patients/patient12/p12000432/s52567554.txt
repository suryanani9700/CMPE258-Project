                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Woman with known effusion, cough, evaluation for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the known left-sided
 effusion is unchanged.  The effusion is restricted to the left lung base and
 to the left sinus.  There is subsequent atelectasis at the left lung base. 
 The well inflated lung parenchyma shows no evidence of pneumonia.  However,
 presence of pneumonia in the atelectatic lung regions cannot be excluded.
 
 Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette.  No pulmonary edema.  At the right
 lower aspect of the trachea, a calcified lymph node might be present.
