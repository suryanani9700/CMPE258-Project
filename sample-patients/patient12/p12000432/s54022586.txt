                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with fever and cough.  Question pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest are compared to previous exam
 from ___.  There is increased opacity at the left lung base
 obscuring the left hemidiaphragm.  This is compatible with at least some
 component of pleural effusion with possible underlying consolidation. 
 Elsewhere, the lungs are clear.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is grossly
 within normal limits.  There are unchanged wedge deformities identified in the
 lower thoracic and potentially upper lumbar spine.   
 
 IMPRESSION:  Left base opacity compatible with component of effusion with
 possible underlying consolidation.
