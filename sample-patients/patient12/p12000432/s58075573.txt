                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Dementia, back pain.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Semi-upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The heart size remains mildly enlarged.  Aorta is tortuous and calcified. 
 Mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged, and the pulmonary vasculature is
 not engorged.  Lung volumes are low which causes crowding of the
 bronchovascular structures.  Patchy atelectasis in the left lung base is
 noted.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present. 
 There is diffuse demineralization of the osseous structures.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Minor left basilar atelectasis.
